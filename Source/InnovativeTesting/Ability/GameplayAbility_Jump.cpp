/* Epic comment */
/**
 *	Canceling an non instanced ability is tricky. Right now this works for Jump since there is nothing that can go wrong by calling
 *	StopJumping() if you aren't already jumping. If we had a montage playing non instanced ability, it would need to make sure the
 *	Montage that *it* played was still playing, and if so, to cancel it. If this is something we need to support, we may need some
 *	light weight data structure to represent 'non intanced abilities in action' with a way to cancel/end them.
